Implementation Process
Our group collectively brainstormed the 3 visualizations and their features. We then were responsible for implementing 1 visualization each. Andrew created the line graph, Irene created the boxplot, and Brain created the radar graph. During the implementation process, we pair-programmed over Zoom to debug code and collaborately-implement additional interactive features based on our design review. Finally, we came together again to write the body text and film the demo.
